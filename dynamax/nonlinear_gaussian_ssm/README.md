# Nonlinear Gaussian State Space Models

We provide a model  definition for SSMs with nonlinear dynamics and/or nonlinear observations;
we assume additive Gaussian noise. 
A variety of deterministic inference algorithsms (e.g., EKF, UKF, GGF) are supported.
Parameter estimation is not yet supported, since the nonlinear functions are treated as blackboxes;
however, the user can roll their own learning code.
