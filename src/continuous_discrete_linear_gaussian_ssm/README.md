# Continuous Discrete Linear Gaussian State Space Models

- Implementation of the Continuous-discrete Linear Gaussian State Space Models
    - We provide a model class definition
    - NB: t0 and t1 refer to t_k and t_{k+1}
        
- We provide the Continuous Discrete Kalman Filter I implementation
    - i.e., Algorithm 3.15 in (Sarkka's proper reference)

- We provide the Continuous Discrete Kalman Smoother I implementation
    - i.e., Algorithm 3.17 in (Sarkka's proper reference)
    
- We hope to provide code for parameter estimation.
